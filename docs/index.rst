F5 SDK (Python) documentation
=============================

Introduction
------------

The F5 SDK Python provides client libraries to access various F5 products and services. It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services. 


Benefits: 

- Provides hand-written or auto-generated client code to make F5’s APIs/services simple and intuitive to use.  
- Handles the low-level details of communication with the API or service, including authentication sessions, async task handling, protocol handling, large file uploads, and more.  
- Can be installed using familiar package management tools such as pip. 



Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Linux (Major distros)
- Mac OS (future, for official support)
- Windows (future, for official support)
